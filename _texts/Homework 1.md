[Intro]
- A long, long time ago
- I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
- And I knew if I had my chance
- That I could make those people dance
- And maybe they'd be happy for a while

- But February made me shiver
- With every paper I'd deliver
- Bad news on the doorstep
- I couldn't take one more step

- I can't remember if I cried
- When I read about his widowed bride
- But something touched me deep inside
- The day the music died

[Chorus:]
- So bye, bye, Miss American Pie[^fn2]
- Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
- And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
- Singin' this'll be the day that I die
- This'll be the day that I die

[Verse 1]
- Did you write the book of love
- And do you have faith in God above
- If the Bible tells you so?
- Now do you believe in rock and roll?
- Can music save your mortal soul?
- And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

- Well, I know that you're in love with him
- 'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
- You both kicked off your shoes
- Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

- I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
- With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
- But I knew I was out of luck
- The day the music died

[Chorus:]
- I started singing bye, bye, Miss American Pie
- Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
- Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
- Singin' this'll be the day that I die
- This'll be the day that I die

[Verse 2]
- Now for ten years we've been on our own
- And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
- But that's not how it used to be
- When the jester sang for the king and queen
- In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
- And a voice that came from you and me

- Oh, and while the king was looking down
- The jester stole his thorny crown
- The courtroom was adjourned
- No verdict was returned

- And while Lennon read a book on Marx
- The quartet practiced in the park
- And we sang dirges in the dark
- The day the music died

[Chorus:]
- We were singing bye, bye, Miss American Pie
- Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
- Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
- Singin' this'll be the day that I die
- This'll be the day that I die

[Verse 3]
- Helter skelter in a summer swelter
- The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
- Eight miles high and falling fast
- It landed foul on the grass
- The players tried for a forward pass
- With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

- Now the halftime air was sweet perfume
- While the sergeants played a marching tune
- We all got up to dance
- Oh, but we never got the chance

- 'Cause the players tried to take the field
- The marching band refused to yield
- Do you recall what was revealed
- The day the music died?

[Chorus:]
- We started singing bye, bye, Miss American Pie
- Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
- Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
- And singin' this'll be the day that I die
- This'll be the day that I die

[Verse 4]
- Oh, and there we were all in one place
- A generation lost in space
- With no time left to start again
- So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
- Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
- 'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

- Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
- My hands were clenched in fists of rage
- No angel born in Hell
- Could break that Satan's spell

- And as the flames climbed high into the night
- To light the sacrificial rite
- I saw Satan laughing with delight
- The day the music died

[Chorus:]
- He was singing bye, bye, Miss American Pie
- Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
- Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
- And singin' this'll be the day that I die
- This'll be the day that I die

[Outro]
- I met a girl who sang the blues
- And I asked her for some happy news
- But she just smiled and turned away
- I went down to the sacred store
- Where I'd heard the music years before
- But the man there said the music wouldn't play

- And in the streets, the children screamed
- The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
- But not a word was spoken
- The church bells all were broken

- And the three men I admire most
- The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
- They caught the last train for the coast
- The day the music died
- And they were singing

[Deleted Verse][^fn3]
- And there I stood alone and afraid
- I dropped to my knees and there I prayed
- And I promised him everything I could give
- If only he would make the music live
- And he promised it would live once more
- But this time one would equal four
- And in five years four had come to mourn
- And the music was reborn[^fn4]

[Chorus:]
- Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
- Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
- And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
- Singin' this'll be the day that I die
- This'll be the day that I die

[Chorus:]
- They were singing bye, bye, Miss American Pie
- Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
- Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
- And singin' this'll be the day that I die[^fn5][^fn6]

## Footnotes

[^fn1]: 

	Don McLean released American Pie in 1971 on the album of the same name. The entire song is teeming with references to pop-culture. According to Genius Lyrics, "this song tackles the evolution of rock & roll through the 60s, following the 1959 plane crash that led to the death of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and The Big Bopper. McLean explores many of the major events of the 60s, including the moon landings, Dylan’s rise and crash, the dominance of The Beatles, and the death of Janis Joplin.""
	For many years, McLean did not explain the song himself, In fact, when asked its meaning, he said: “It means I never have to work again.”  

	> - On a windy day let's go flying
	> - There may be no trees to rest on
	> - There may be no clouds to ride
	> - But we'll have our wings and the wind will be with us
	> - That's enough for me, that's enough for me.
	{:.poetry}

[^fn2]: American Pie combines the two terms “Miss America” and “as American as apple pie”.

[^fn3]: Please note that this verse was delete but later divulged in Don McLean’s manuscript from 1971, which was sold and released in April, 2015.

[^fn4]: It is believed that the day “the music died” refers to the infamous plane crash, which killed Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper. Five years later, The Beatles went on their first US tour “and the music was reborn”.

[^fn5]: Also from Genius Lyrics, "McLean’s track will forever be regarded as a poetic look into the past of rock & roll."
